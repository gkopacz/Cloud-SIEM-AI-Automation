This lab replicates a real SOC workflow from collecting endpoint logs to correlating events in Elastic SIEM and using AI automation in Tines for alert triage and incident escalation.

## üéØ Objective

I built this lab to explore how cloud-hosted endpoints can be monitored and protected using **Elastic SIEM** and **AI-driven automation** with Tines. My goal was to simulate a complete detection and response cycle, from collecting endpoint logs to automating incident triage in a way that mirrors actual SOC workflows.

## üß† Skills Demonstrated
- Deployment and configuration of **Windows Server 2025** on AWS EC2
- Installation and setup of **Elastic Agent** for log forwarding
- Creation and tuning of **Elastic SIEM correlation rules**
- Integration of **Tines** for automated alert triage and escalation
- Endpoint security configuration (firewall, antivirus, logging)
- Workflow automation for SOC tasks using AI-powered orchestration
- Simulation of detection and response scenarios

# üõ†Ô∏è Setup Walkthrough

I started by spinning up a Windows Server 2025 instance on AWS EC2 to serve as my monitored endpoint. After installing the Elastic Agent, I configured it to send security event logs to **Elastic SIEM**, where I had set up detection rules to catch suspicious activities.  
> üí° If you don‚Äôt already have an AWS account, take a look at this guide before starting: [AWS Account Setup](https://learn.nextwork.org/projects/aws-account-setup)

Once the SIEM was generating alerts, I connected **Tines** to automate the triage process. Tines would check the alert context, decide if it was a false positive or a genuine incident, and then either close it or escalate it to me for review. This allowed me to test both the detection and response phases without manual intervention for every alert.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Launch AWS EC2 Instance**  

I started by creating a Windows Server 2025 instance in AWS EC2 to serve as the monitored endpoint for this lab.  

I named the instance **Windows-Srv** and selected the **Microsoft Windows Server 2025 Base** AMI from the Quick Start tab. 

This AMI is free tier eligible and provided directly by Amazon.

![AWS EC2 - Name and AMI Selection](https://github.com/gkopacz/Cloud-SIEM-AI-Automation/blob/main/images/Name_and_machine_type.png)

I chose the **m7i-flex.large** instance type (2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM) and created a new key pair named **Windows-Srv-key** for RDP access. 

The `.pem` file was downloaded and saved localy.  

![AWS EC2 - Instance Type and Key Pair](https://github.com/gkopacz/Cloud-SIEM-AI-Automation/blob/main/images/instance_and_key.png)  

In the network settings, I allowed inbound **RDP traffic** only from my IP address and configured **30 GB gp3 SSD storage**. 

Encryption was left disabled.  

![AWS EC2 - Network Settings and Storage](https://github.com/gkopacz/Cloud-SIEM-AI-Automation/blob/main/images/network_and_storage.png)  

After reviewing all settings, I clicked **Launch instance** to deploy the server.  

![AWS EC2 - Launch Instance](https://github.com/gkopacz/Cloud-SIEM-AI-Automation/blob/main/images/launch_instance.png)

Once the instance was running, I selected it from the EC2 dashboard, clicked **Actions ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Get Windows password**.  

![AWS EC2 - Get Windows Password](https://github.com/gkopacz/Cloud-SIEM-AI-Automation/blob/main/images/get_windows_password.png)  

On the next screen, I uploaded my previously downloaded **Windows-Srv-key.pem** file and clicked **Decrypt password** to reveal the Administrator login credentials.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Install Elastic Agent & Integrate Elastic Defender**  

With the AWS instance running, I proceeded to install the Elastic Agent so that logs from the Windows Server could be sent to Elastic SIEM for monitoring and analysis.  

First, I logged into [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/) and created a new account. 

I clicked **Start Free Trial** and made sure to select **Elastic SIEM** during the setup process so the deployment would include all necessary SIEM features by default.  

Once the deployment was ready, I navigated to **Assets ‚Üí Fleet ‚Üí Agents ‚Üí Add Agent**.   

![Elastic Cloud - Add Agent Menu](https://github.com/gkopacz/Cloud-SIEM-AI-Automation/blob/main/images/add_agent_elastic.png)  

I clicked Add agent, created a new agent policy named Windows-Srv-AWS, and confirmed that the System integration was included.

![Elastic Cloud - Add Agent Menu](https://github.com/gkopacz/Cloud-SIEM-AI-Automation/blob/main/images/create-agent-policy.png)  

I selected **Windows** as the platform and copied the provided PowerShell installation command.

![Elastic Cloud - Add Agent Windows](https://github.com/gkopacz/Cloud-SIEM-AI-Automation/blob/main/images/powershell.png)  

On the Windows Server, I opened **PowerShell as Administrator** and pasted the installation command. 

![Elastic Cloud - AWS-powershell](https://github.com/gkopacz/Cloud-SIEM-AI-Automation/blob/main/images/aws-powershell.png)  

This command downloaded the Elastic Agent MSI, installed it, and enrolled it into the Fleet using the enrollment token from Elastic Cloud.  

![Elastic Cloud - AWS_Powershell_Success](https://github.com/gkopacz/Cloud-SIEM-AI-Automation/blob/main/images/aws-powershell-success.png)  

Once the installation was complete, I returned to the Elastic Cloud Fleet dashboard to confirm the agent‚Äôs status. 

The agent showed as **Healthy**, indicating it was successfully connected and sending data.  

![Elastic Cloud - agent_done](https://github.com/gkopacz/Cloud-SIEM-AI-Automation/blob/main/images/agent-installed.png)  

Once the agent was enrolled, I added the **Elastic Defend** integration to my `Windows-Srv-AWS` agent policy.  

![Elastic Cloud - integration](https://github.com/gkopacz/Cloud-SIEM-AI-Automation/blob/main/images/add_integration.png)

I named the integration `Elastic-Defend-WinSrv-AWS` and selected **Complete EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response)** to enable full telemetry.

![Elastic Cloud - integration](https://github.com/gkopacz/Cloud-SIEM-AI-Automation/blob/main/images/edit_integration.png)

> üí° By doing this, Elastic Defend was **automatically deployed** to my AWS Windows Server endpoint via the Elastic Agent, providing real-time monitoring and protection.  

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create Workflow Automation in Tines

I moved on to building an automated workflow in **Tines** that will process the alert, generate an AI summary, and email it directly to me.

I logged into my **Tines** workspace and clicked **New Story**, naming it `Admin_Sign-in_Detection` so I could easily identify it later.

![Elastic Cloud - initialize](https://github.com/gkopacz/Cloud-SIEM-AI-Automation/blob/main/images/init_workflow.png)

From the left-hand menu, I dragged the **Webhook** action onto the canvas.

This is the **entry point** for the alert that Elastic SIEM sends.

![Elastic Cloud - webhook](https://github.com/gkopacz/Cloud-SIEM-AI-Automation/blob/main/images/workflow_webhook.png)

Next, I dragged an **AI** action from the menu and connected it to my **Webhook Action**.

I renamed it **Summarize webhook data** and set the **Prompt** to:

```
Summarize the following data in one sentence.
Provide some next action steps for the analyst to take when retrieving this alert.
Format this into bullet points to make it easy to read for the email.
```

![Elastic Cloud - sumarize](https://github.com/gkopacz/Cloud-SIEM-AI-Automation/blob/main/images/workflow_sumarize.png)

> üí° I made sure to reference the webhook data by adding: `{{ webhook_action }}`

Finally, I dragged a **Send Email** action onto the canvas and connected it to my **AI Action**.

I configured it as seen in the image below.

![Elastic Cloud - email](https://github.com/gkopacz/Cloud-SIEM-AI-Automation/blob/main/images/workflow_email.png)

At this point, my workflow looked like this:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Webhook Action** ‚Üí receives the alert from Elastic  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Summarize webhook data** (AI Action) ‚Üí processes and formats the alert details  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Send Email Action** ‚Üí delivers the summary to my inbox

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ 

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Simulate and Validate the Workflow**  

To test end-to-end functionality, I generated benign triggers such as multiple failed RDP logins and harmless PowerShell commands.  
The events were ingested by Elastic, matched to active rules, and sent to Tines.  
Tines correctly closed low-priority events and escalated high-priority detections, confirming the lab workflow was operational.



## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Enable and Configure SIEM Rules**  

Inside the Elastic Security app, I enabled a set of built-in Windows rules to detect:  
- Suspicious PowerShell execution  
- RDP brute force attempts  
- Service installation events  
I also set rules to generate alerts directly in the Elastic Security console for faster testing.
