## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **cloud-based SOC workflow** integrating:
- **AWS-hosted Windows Server 2025**
- **Elastic SIEM** for centralized log collection and correlation
- **Tines** for AI-driven workflow automation
- **Endpoint + SIEM integration** for complete security visibility

This lab simulates real-world SOC operations — from log ingestion and rule correlation to automated alert handling and incident escalation — all powered by **AI orchestration**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **AWS EC2** (Windows Server 2025)
- **Elastic SIEM** (Log monitoring & correlation rules)
- **Tines** (AI-powered automation workflows)
- **Endpoint Security Tools** (EDR, Antivirus, Network Logs)

## 🚀 Deployment Steps
1. **Provision AWS EC2** Windows Server 2025.
2. **Install Elastic Agent** to forward logs to Elastic SIEM.
3. **Configure SIEM correlation rules** for detection.
4. **Integrate Tines** with Elastic to automate alert workflows.
5. **Test and simulate incidents** to validate automation.

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
- Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)
- SIEM Rule Creation & Tuning
- Security Automation & Orchestration (SOAR)
- Endpoint Integration
- AI-Driven Incident Response
